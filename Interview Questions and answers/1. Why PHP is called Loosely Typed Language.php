// ^ 1. Why PHP is called Loosely Typed Language ? 

Ans : 

// A loosly typed language is one that doesn't need you to define the type of variable you are declaring.

// Few examples that will tell you the clear difference:

//  ^ In c, you define an int as:

// ! int c = 1; // assingment is not mandatary

// ^ In PHP:

// ! $PHP = 1; // assignment defines the type of variable

// In comparison to strict type language you cannot define a different kind of value in a different kind of variable e.g. int will only have int value, you cannot put a string in that.

// But in PHP you can change the type of variable anytime you want. E.g.

// $PHP = 1; // becomes int

// $PHP = “I AM NOW A STRING”;
